    -   View ticket status and conversation history.
    -   Reply to comments on their own tickets.
    -   Receive email notifications.

    -   Can also create tickets on behalf of users.

-   **Admin**:
    -   Full oversight of the system.

## üîÑ Ticket Lifecycle

The basic flow for a ticket from creation to resolution is simple and intuitive:

1.  **Creation**: A user registers/logs in and creates a new ticket. The ticket is set to **Open**.
2.  **Assignment**: A support agent views the open ticket queue, picks up a ticket, and changes its status to **In Progress**.
3.  **Resolution**: The agent works on the issue, communicates with the user via comments, and eventually marks the ticket as **Resolved**.
4.  **Closure**: After resolution, the ticket is automatically or manually moved to the **Closed** state.

The status flow is strictly maintained:
`Open` ‚Üí `In Progress` ‚Üí `Resolved` ‚Üí `Closed`
